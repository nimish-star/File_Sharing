# File_Sharing

The project involves creating a file-sharing system using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. Users can upload files, and upon successful upload, the system generates a unique link for each file. This link can be shared with others, allowing them to access and download the shared file. The system ensures secure and convenient file sharing through a user-friendly interface.
